# HW-Wireframe
Assignment1
Assignment: 1 Wireframe Project

Wire frame assignment is basic which involves usage of static HTML page styling it with css.
I have partioned the page into four sections.
1. Header
2. Nav
3. section and aside
4. footer
Header: it has basic section and styled with css using  text align to center, background color,font color,margin left-right and bottom,padding on the top and height.

Nav: it has the same components as header.

Section: it has the basic components like header and nav but used the position:relative and float left.

aside: it has the basic components like header and nav but used the position:relative and float left.

footer: it has basic section and styled with css using  text align to center, background color,font color,margin left-right and bottom,padding on the top and height.

I have used HTML and CSS to complete the project.
